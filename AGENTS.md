## Project structure

The `src/layouts/Layout.astro` file contains the default page layout.
The pages within the site are wrapped with the default page layout.
For example, `src/pages/index.astro` is the index page, wrapped in `Layout.astro`.
Components are found in `src/components` and may be imported from layouts or pages.

Static assets that are served without modification may be placed in `public/` for bundling.
